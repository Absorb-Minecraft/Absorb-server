Game:
  Ticks:
    # The amount of Minecraft ticks per second. This is typically 20, however you can
    # increase this to increase the game speed or decrease it to slow down the game speed.
    # Please note unlike vanilla Minecraft whereby if the tick speed goes below 20,
    # Player's start to lag, Absorb does not connect the players to tick speed, meaning
    # that lowering this will only change the games speed.
    PerSecond: 20
Network:
  # uPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a feature that will port forward this server for you,
  # as well as close the port when you're done. Please note that uPnP is only supported by
  # some routers and is typically disabled by default for security reasons (any program
  # on your network (Wi-Fi, ethernet, etc) can open a port and then let anything in).
  # While the security risk is on the routers side and not on the servers side, we have
  # disabled it by default for peace of mind. While we recommend manually port forwarding,
  # this option is here for those who can't port forward, those who trust every program on
  # the network or really don't care about the security risk of having it enabled on the router.
  uPnP: false
  # This must be above the number 0 and a whole number. The port number allows you to run multiple
  # servers on the same computer whereby to join a specified server, you include the port number
  # after the IP/Hostname such as 'localhost:25555'
  Port: 25565
